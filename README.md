### Hello People of the World! 

Lane Davis here.  Alaskan and proud.  World traveller.  US Navy Veteran.  Life long learner extraordinaire.
I'm here to disrupt the world of coding as my new creative outlet.  I have conquered the wilds of the last frontier, the seven seas, and now my aim is set at the digital world! I have a passion for creating exciting new content in all forms, be it digital videos, music, or web.  Also, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast with a specialty in backpacking and camping.

- 💻 I am currently learning fullstack web development, diving into Asynchronous Code.
- 💪🏻 I am decent with the following: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MVC Patterns and JavaScript.
- 🌱 Interested in learning more about data analysis and machine learning

"It's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."
